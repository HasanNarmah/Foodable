# CS2001: Group Project 2021/22

This is a template of the README markdown (extension .md)  file. For tips on how to edit the markdown click [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)!


Use this template to inform your clients about:

1. What is this web application? - This web application is going to cover SDG 2 and 3, where we are going to be helping those who need food and those who want to donate by creating a webpage which will allow users to donate long-life products via their local foodbanks and the receiver will have the choice to tailor it to their needs such as (Vegan, Halal...etc). Our web application is different since most of the food donation websites do not currently have the option for you to find the local foodbanks(this is something which makes it easier for the user). 
2. What are its capabilities i.e. features? Email Integration, Rewards system for donator, Login System, Verification system, List of Local food banks to donate food, Filtering Care Packages according to receiver’s needs
3. How to install the code (including any dependencies)?
4. How to run the web application? The web application will be avaiable to access via website.

## Project Idea

### UN Sustainable development goal number: 2 and 3

### Motivation: We decided to do this because this would be covering the above goals, we believe this app would be useful since many people do not have easy access to food, and this webpage is going to allow the user to donate and receive . They will even receive vouchers once they reach a certain goal which motivates the user to donate more and the ones in need will receive the food.

### Features:
Requirements – Functional

As a user, I need to create an account so that I can log on the website to donate Food
As a user, I need to have a system to ensure that the right food is going to the right people.
As a user, I need to have a way that foodbank can get in touch with us to allow them as one of our chains to provide Food as well to donate in person.
As a user, I need to create rewards for people who donate food through our website. 
As a user, I want the ability to donate Food as well as Money.

Requirements – Non-Functional

As a user, I want the site to have minimised downtime that ensures that the site can work to the best of its ability. 
As a user, I need to ensure that GDPR laws are taken in account of and allow the choice to stop tracking and keeping personal information of logs. 
As a user, I need to ensure that the security of each user account is validated through a medium like an email.
As a user, I need to use this website on any device that has an internet connection. 

Requirements – User Interface 

As a user, I need a simple and easy way to give my details as a customer to use this website.
As a user, I need to be able to easily navigate this website with little to no instructions
As a user, I need to be able to sign up easily and ensure I can make the right donation.
