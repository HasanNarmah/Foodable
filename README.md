## Project Idea

### UN Sustainable development goal number: 2 and 3

### Motivation: We decided to do this because this would be covering the above goals, we believe this app would be useful since many people do not have easy access to food, and this webpage is going to allow the user to donate and receive . They will even receive vouchers once they reach a certain goal which motivates the user to donate more and the ones in need will receive the food.
